## Project Title: SafehouseNYC

A web app for showcasing Crime statistics with Real Estate listings.

## Project Description

The goal of the project is to create a real estate marketplace application that not only provides
real estate listings, but also showcases neighborhood crime statistics for each listing. The focus of
the project is New York City. The project aims to help prospective real estate renters and buyers
make more informed decisions about where to live and contribute to creating safer communities.

The importance of the project lies in its potential to make the process of finding a home less
daunting and time-consuming while creating safer communities by making information about
crime rates more accessible and transparent. Furthermore, our application can help communities
be vigilant and work together to create a safe and supportive environment through Neighborhood
Watch Programs and Community Policing.

Ultimately, the project can help people feel more comfortable and confident in their choice of
dwelling, leading to happier and more fulfilling lives.

Our application is perfect for potential renters and buyers looking for a quick and easy way to get
their dream home, for short-term or long-term.
