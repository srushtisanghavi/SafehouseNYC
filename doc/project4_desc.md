### Safehouse NYC

The goal of the project is to create a real estate marketplace application that not only provides
real estate listings, but also showcases neighborhood crime statistics for each listing. The focus of
the project is New York City. The project aims to help prospective real estate renters and buyers
make more informed decisions about where to live and contribute to creating safer communities.
